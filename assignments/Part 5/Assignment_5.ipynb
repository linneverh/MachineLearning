Nintendo became the first company to score zero out of a possible 10 points in the Greenpeace ranking and provided no information to consumers on the substances it uses or future elimination of hazardous materials, the environmental organisation said.  Microsoft, judged on its Zune MP3 player and Xbox game console, lost points for its pledge to eliminate toxic chemicals only in 2011 and for having no voluntary takeback program. Microsoft said in a statement that it is committed to environmental progress. &#34;In our consumer electronics business, we comply with and exceed all environmental guidelines and regulations,&#34; while ensuring the durability, safety and performance of products, the company said. A public relations firm working for Nintendo said it was unaware of the Greenpeace report and was checking. Greenpeace said TV producers Philips and Sharp have poor policies on taking back and recycling outdated products. Greenpeace added the four companies to its quarterly environmental rankings for the first time and put them at the bottom of the list of 18 companies.

Beck was a sophomore at Berkeley, taking a class in international rural development. The daughter of an orthopedic surgeon, she had gone to college planning to do premed, but environmental science caught her interest, and the story of the Ittu Oromo precipitated a change of major. [\\u2026] Beck likes to call the I.M.F., the W.T.O., and the World Bank \\\"the iron triangle of corporate rule.\\\" In her view, these institutions-their leaders, clients, political allies, and, above all, true bosses, multinational corporations-are frog-marching humanity, along with the rest of the planet, into a toxic, money-maddened, repressive future. And she intends to persuade the rest of us not to go quietly. [\\u2026] Bank officials have consistently vowed to improve this record, to start funding projects that benefit not only big business and Third World elites but also the world's poor. Accordingly, projects with non-governmental organizations and other \\\"civil society\\\" groups, along with efforts to promote access to health care and education, have increased. But Bank contracts are worth millions, and multinational corporations have remained major beneficiaries. In 1995, Lawrence Summers, then an under-secretary at the Treasury Department-he is now its Secretary-told Congress that for each dollar the American government contributed to the World Bank, American corporations received $1.35 in procurement contracts. One of the Bank's major proposals at the moment is for the development of oilfields in Chad, in central Africa, and the construction of an oil pipeline running more than six hundred miles to the coast at Cameroon. The environmental impact of this pipeline is predicted by many to be dire, the benefits to the people in the area minimal. The big winners will, in all likelihood, be the Bank's major partners in the project-Exxon Mobil and CHEVRON. [\\u2026]\",\n          \"[\\u2026] BP was expected to be hung out to dry by rivals today amid claims money-saving short-cuts and blunders caused the worst oil spill in US history. The oil giant was dragged before Congress, where it faced accusations of favouring cost savings over safety in the days leading up to the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Executives from rival firms including Exxon Mobil, CHEVRON, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell were also due to quizzed over the disaster. [...] Millions of gallons of oil have spilled into the Gulf, devastating 120 miles of coastline and making BP chief executive Tony Hayward public enemy number one in the US. [...]\",\n          \"The declaration from the Handmade Consortium materialized on a Web site called buyhandmade.org in late October. ''I pledge to buy handmade this holiday season, and request that others do the same for me,'' it said, and you could type in your name to ''sign'' on. Within weeks, more than 6,500 people had done so. ''Buying handmade is better for people,'' a statement on the site read in part, and ''better for the environment,'' because mass production is a ''major cause'' of global warming, among other things. There were links to an anti-sweatshop site and a Wal-Mart watchdog site. The pledge echoed the idealistic language of an environmental advocacy group, but actually the consortium's most prominent member was the online shopping bazaar Etsy, a for-profit entity. Etsy is an online craft fair where individuals from all over the world sell things that they have made.

In the process, it vented gas into the air and discharged wastes laced with industrial solvents and radioactive substances into recharge basins and leaching pools. Now, 50 years later, radiological and chemical contamination of soil and groundwater remains at the former plant -- one of a string of low-profile nuclear weapons sites across the country that came to light in an article published by USA Today in 6. There are disagreements over the threat this contamination poses. The state Department of Environmental Conservation, the government agency most directly involved, says it is confident the risk is low. \\\"We have studied this thing inside out and continue to do so, and we are not finding contaminants that pose a substantial risk, or pathways of exposure,\\\" said Mark Lowery, a department spokesman. The department said it was stringently overseeing a voluntary cleanup being carried out by VERIZON, Sylvania's corporate successor, and would see to it that all necessary remediation is done.[\\u2026] But the Star Foundation of East Hampton, a group involved with nuclear contamination issues and headed by a former Energy Department official, contends that a problem of unknown but potentially significant dimensions is being glossed over.The foundation says that far greater government effort, including federal involvement, is needed to find out the full extent of the contamination, to gauge the threats to wells supplying drinking water and to assess past and present health risks. [\\u2026] Leaders of a civic association in Jericho Gardens, a Hicksville neighborhood west of the site, said that they, too, were satisfied with the state and VERIZON efforts. \\\"I don't see any reason for concern,\\\" said Cynthia Perkins-Roberts, a past president. \\\"Maybe if someone can show some documentation, we'll feel differently.\\\"[\\u2026] Sharon Cohen-Hagar, a VERIZON spokeswoman, confirmed that the company was cooperating with the state in a voluntary cleanup. She said that GTE Operations Support was carrying out the work. GTE, which acquired Sylvania, merged two years ago with Bell Atlantic to become VERIZON.[\\u2026] There is some disagreement about what the Hicksville plant made. Ms. Cohen-Hagar said it was the company's understanding that it manufactured reactor parts including nuclear fuel rods that were used for electric power generation and research. She said that a search of company records found no evidence that nuclear fuel was recycled at the site.[\\u2026]\",\n          \"RESOURCE companies, along with transporter Toll and insurers such as QBE, are expected to be among those Australian companies hardest hit by the effects of climate change, according to a study by investment bank CITIGROUP. The bank this week will release what it hails as the first major study into the expected effect of global warming on the top-100 companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.[\\u2026] The CITIGROUP report will coincide with an expected announcement from the federal Government, which this week will table the details of its business-aligned task force into a carbon trading system.[\\u2026] CITIGROUP director of global strategy Bruce Rolph said investors were beginning to exert pressure on asset managers to assess the effect of global warming on their share portfolios. [\\u2026] The CITIGROUP study also found parts of the health sector could benefit from climate change because of a forecast jump in tropical diseases.

[\\u2026] The stark report is by Stern and Carbon Tracker, a thinktank supported by organisations including HSBC, Citi, Standard and Poor's and the International Energy Agency. The Bank of England has also recognised that a collapse in the value of oil, gas and coal assets as nations tackle global warming is a potential systemic risk to the economy, with London being particularly at risk owing to its huge listings of coal. [\\u2026] The world's governments have agreed to restrict the global temperature rise to 2C, beyond which the impacts become severe and unpredictable. But Stern said the investors clearly did not believe action to curb climate change was going to be taken. \\\"They can't believe that and also believe that the markets are sensibly valued now.\\\" [\\u2026]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"evaluation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 5,\n        \"min\": 2002,\n        \"max\": 2013,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2002\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"month\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"day\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"13\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pr_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The iPad 2, made in China but yet to go on sale there, is being bought in London and smuggled back into the country where it is manufactured.  It means the Apple tablet is creating extra carbon emissions as it travels halfway across the world and back again. Customers are queuing to buy the iPad 2 at Apple shops in London and send them 6,000 miles back to China. The tablets are bought for their retail price of £399 for a 16GB model and then taken to China, where they sell for £430. The profit is not in this small mark-up but in the 20% Vat - in this case almost £80 - Chinese tourists can reclaim when they take the iPads out of the country. No tax is paid to the Chinese authorities by the smugglers. It means a student who takes home six iPads can fund his trip to London. […]\",\n",

[…] Beck likes to call the I.M.F., the W.T.O., and the World Bank \"the iron triangle of corporate rule.\" In her view, these institutions-their leaders, clients, political allies, and, above all, true bosses, multinational corporations-are frog-marching humanity, along with the rest of the planet, into a toxic, money-maddened, repressive future. And she intends to persuade the rest of us not to go quietly. […] Bank officials have consistently vowed to improve this record, to start funding projects that benefit not only big business and Third World elites but also the world\\'s poor. Accordingly, projects with non-governmental organizations and other \"civil society\" groups, along with efforts to promote access to health care and education, have increased. But Bank contracts are worth millions, and multinational corporations have remained major beneficiaries. In 1995, Lawrence Summers, then an under-secretary at the Treasury Department-he is now its Secretary-told Congress that for each dollar the American government contributed to the World Bank, American corporations received $1.35 in procurement contracts. One of the Bank\\'s major proposals at the moment is for the development of oilfields in Chad, in central Africa, and the construction of an oil pipeline running more than six hundred miles to the coast at Cameroon. The environmental impact of this pipeline is predicted by many to be dire, the benefits to the people in the area minimal.

For example, the recent success of the company AMD in the face of its powerful competitor INTEL is explained to a great degree by the technological progress it has made in dual-core microprocessors, which consume less energy while performing better.[…] The interest paid by some NGOs and by public authorities to the question of waste and hazardous substances is not recent. In 1989, the United Nations adopted the Basle Convention on the export of hazardous substances. Following that first international reference framework, national initiatives have succeeded one another, supported by a series of European directives from 2003 to ensure that waste management in the technology sector is fully taken in hand by producers and distributors. This ever more urgent regulation is leading companies in the sector to make provisions and to organise themselves differently. Waste management combined with the directives concerning hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment not only involves the introduction of recycling processes but also fundamental changes to manufacturing processes, underlying R&D expenditure, the review of product design and so on. In the technology sector, a research institute (AMR Research) has estimated that 2 per cent of companies' revenues in the sector should be allocated to meeting these standards. For its part, the European Commission has estimated a total cost of between E650m and E1.05bn per annum for the Europe of the 15. The impact may also be positive to the extent that companies that are innovative concerning respect for the environment may concentrate on increasing their market share by highlighting this competitive advantage.

Tripa is part of the Leuser Ecosystem, one of the world\\'s most ecologically important rainforests and once home to its densest population of Sumatran orangutans. As recently as 1990, there were 60,000 hectares of swamp forest in Tripa: now just 10,000 remain, the rest grubbed up to make way for palm oil plantations servicing the needs of some of the world\\'s biggest brands. Over the same period, the population of 2,000 orangutans has dwindled to just 200.

According to the Rainforest Foundation\\'s executive director, Simon Counsell, part of the problem is that even companies that do sign up to ethical schemes, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, cannot be certain that all the oil they receive is ethically produced because of the way oil from different plantations is mixed at processing plants. \"The smaller companies sell to bigger companies and it all gets mixed.

              " \"WASHINGTON -- Japanese officials issued broad evacuation orders on Saturday for people living near two nuclear power plants whose cooling systems broke down as a result of the earthquake. The officials warned that small amounts of radioactive material were likely to leak from the plants. The power plants, known as Daiichi and Daini and operated by Tokyo Electric Power, experienced critical failures of the cooling systems after the plants were shut down, as they were during the quake. About 45,000 people were affected by the evacuation order at the Daiichi plant, where those living within a six-mile radius were told to leave. The evacuation of the second plant was for a one-mile radius because ''there is no sign that radiation has been emitted outside,'' an official said. Failure of the cooling systems allowed pressure to build up beyond the design capacity of the reactors. Small amounts of radioactive vapor were expected to be released into the atmosphere to prevent damage to the containment systems, safety officials said. They said that the levels of radiation were not large enough to threaten the health of people outside the plants, and that the evacuations had been ordered as a precaution. Nuclear safety officials focused initially on the Daiichi plant. But by Saturday morning Japan had declared states of emergency for five reactors at the two plants, an escalation that added to worries about the safety of nuclear facilities in the quake-prone Japanese islands. The Daiichi and Daini plants are 10 miles apart in Fukushima Prefecture, about 150 miles north of Tokyo and close to the quake's epicenter off the coast. The plants' problems were described as serious but were far short of a catastrophic emergency like the partial core meltdown that occurred at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa., in 1979. A Japanese nuclear safety panel said the radiation levels were 1,000 times above normal in a reactor control room at the Daiichi plant. Some radioactive material had also seeped outside, with radiation levels near the main gate measured at eight times normal, NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, quoted nuclear safety officials as saying. The safety officials said there was ''no immediate health hazard'' to residents from the leaks, which they described as ''minute,'' and people were urged to stay calm. […] With the steam-driven pump in operation, pressure valves on the reactor vessel would open automatically as pressure rose too high, or could be opened by operators. ''It's not like they have a breach; there's no broken pipe venting steam,'' said Margaret E. Harding, a nuclear safety consultant who managed a team at GENERAL ELECTRIC, the reactors' designer, that analyzed pressure buildup in reactor containments. ''You're getting pops of release valves for minutes, not hours, that take pressure back down.''

Latimer, said last week. Justice John P. DiBlasi ruled last month that the Board and former County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke failed to conduct an adequate analysis of the hangar's environmental impact before approving construction within 1,000 feet of the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla.  A coalition of Hudson Valley, Westchester and Bronx environmental groups sued the Board and the county for violating state environmental laws. The plaintiffs, including the Riverkeeper Fund, the Croton Watershed Clean Water Coalition, the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater and the New York Public Interest Research Group, among others, said the project would supplant natural habitat with concrete and other impenetrable manmade materials and permit storm water runoff and pollutants from the airport to degrade the water supply. General Electric officials have said that the project would not harm water quality and would comply with environmental regulations. Chairman Latimer, who was one of three Legislators voting for further study of the GE proposal under the previous administration, said that if members of the current Board wanted to appeal Judge DiBlasi's decision, they should do so.\",\n",

Well, the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that about 50 million tonnes of e-waste are generated worldwide each year at an annual rate of three to five per cent. Although we can\\'t deny the benefits that ICT products bring about, their usage has placed a heavy burden on our natural resources.  The amount of water and energy used for producing these products is high, and the energy these products consume during their use is high, too. Realising the effects such products have on the environment, major ICT vendors are now moving towards producing what they term as \"green IT\". Research company Forrester Research says vendors like Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Dell, INTEL and Sun Microsystems are investing significant resources in their green initiatives such as energy-efficient servers, data centre power and cooling solutions, cleaner manufacturing and device recycling programmes. These solutions are said to use less energy, but produce the same computing power. On the consumer side, companies like Apple, HP and Dell are said to be in the process of producing green PCs, which are made from non-toxic materials, can run on low energy, and built to be taken apart. These new machines are also highly upgradable and have a longer life of up to eight years. Forrester Research points out that new environmentfriendly products may be slightly more expensive than regular products, but their total cost of ownership will be lower and in the long run its usage costs will be lower as well. These green products, however, will only be in real production in the next two or three years. For the time being, we as consumers can play our part. For example, we can practise refurbishing used equipment, or donating used IT equipment to schools, charities or emerging countries. By doing this, not only can we save our environment, but also play our part in helping our community.',\n",

The Environmental Protection Agency, which had ordered the dredging halted on Friday, said that operations would restart in stages and initially be confined to only three of 11 sites on the river where the dredges had been operating. Additional dredging areas may be added pending another round of water sampling, said Kristen Skopeck, a spokeswoman for the agency.

The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee debated a bill Wednesday that would phase out US use of the Edison-inspired bulb, which has been used to illuminate American homes and businesses for more than a century. There are currently about 4 billion incandescent lamps in use in the US, according to the Energy Department. The bill (S. 2017), which is sponsored by Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the committee's Democratic chairman, is driven by the fact that conventional incandescent bulbs use far more energy than advanced lighting devices.

              " \"The technocrats are on the ascent and nuclear power is yet again on the cards for South Africa. How has the moratorium of 2008 been reversed? How can nuclear power, which was then considered an unaffordable option, suddenly have become affordable again? This is a story with many twists and turns. The nuclear lobby is, like any major industry, well resourced. It has consistently managed to project positions, which appear logical and reasonable - that nuclear power is safe, reduces greenhouse emissions and is reliable. It also claims nuclear power should be an integral part of the mix of energy generation systems, especially in light of global warming because it emits less CO2 than fossil fuel sources. Nuclear is easy to justify against coal power, the worlds dominant and most dangerous power source. Coal releases vast amounts of noxious gases releasing mercury and creating acid rain and global warming. Mining coal is environmentally damaging and dangerous.  But when we consider nuclear power we must figure its affordability against a full suite of alternatives. For starters, let's take fossil fuel power generation off the table. That is so yesterday, it has to go. Sustainable energy is rapidly becoming competitive. Wind and solar power can already compete directly with fossil fuels and nuclear power. The game-changer in sustainable energy in South Africa could be energy from ocean currents, tapping into our constant 5 kph (kilometers per hour) ocean river, the Aghulas current that runs down our East Coast. This can provide the elusive holy grail of sustainable energy - a constant base load electricity supply. All we need to provide is the plant - the fuel is free. There are other sustainable energy base load options. Concentrated solar is one, solar chimneys another. Wave power has huge potential. Heat conversion and capture from ocean themoclines and deep mines is also attractive. While nuclear is presented as a safe, mature industry, appearances are deceptive. First, the full cost accounting for nuclear remains vague. Each nuclear site must be cared for up to a century after ceasing operation. Decommissioning, maintenance, waste management and storage, along with a raft of other hidden costs are generally excluded in initial cost estimates. The true costs of decommissioning nuclear power stations is constantly rising, exemplified by experience in the UK where estimated decommissioning costs exceed GBP 73 billion (R788bn). […] Some nuclear supporters masquerade as objective overseers of the industry. The International Atomic Energy Agency not only regulates, but also actively pursues the interests of the nuclear industry. Major industrial groups like GENERAL ELECTRIC, Westinghouse and Alstrom overtly promote nuclear power through direct lobbying. The industry has a lengthy track record of underhand lobbying tactics and power plays, which place it firmly in the same league as the chemical or arms industries. […]\",\n",

So when word got out this spring that the federal Environmental Protection Agency had chosen Saratoga Springs for its upstate field office -- the staging area for its long-delayed program to dredge the Hudson of its PCB pollution -- the reaction was swift. A Fort Edward newspaper published a cartoon showing E.P.A. workers in biohazard suits sipping Champagne at a lawn party with the horse-and-pearls set.   The E.P.A., many people said, had struck a tone-deaf note in its first decision after more than 20 years of study, revealing how little had been learned about the river and its people. The government promptly surrendered. Contractors are now working double shifts renovating a building in Fort Edward, not far from the most polluted areas. The office will open in May, two months behind schedule.  \"Nobody other than us thought it was a good idea,\" said Richard Caspe, an E.P.A. program director who will oversee the cleanup. Mr. Caspe said the Saratoga Springs site was chosen because it was in move-in condition and close to the New York State Thruway, not because it was nice. \"So you live and you learn. We\\'re big enough people that we\\'re willing to live and learn.\" The stumble may well be forgotten on a project that lasts 10 years or longer. But many people here and within the E.P.A. say that as a first step it also set the tone of what will be one of the largest industrial cleanups in United States history. The issues of engineering, transportation and hydrology are expected to be daunting, environmental experts say. But the political and human dimensions -- especially the degree to which the government has pledged to involve the community in planning and decision-making -- are likely to be just as crucial to the project\\'s success or failure. And hanging over everything is the heavy hand of history. Many residents here, and some scientists within the E.P.A., have lived the battle of the Hudson PCB\\'s for much of their adult lives and careers, ever since 1976, when Congress banned all sale or use of the chemicals as evidence grew about its human health effects and impact on wildlife.  From the first studies to track down the estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCB\\'s that were spilled or discharged from the General Electric Company\\'s factories in Fort Edward and in nearby Hudson Falls, through the subsequent political battles that raged from Albany to Washington about proposed remedies, positions became hardened and entrenched. General Electric spent millions of dollars on scientific studies and advertisements arguing that sediment had entombed the chemicals, insulating them from the recovering life of the river. Mr. Caspe and other E.P.A. officials acknowledged that errors and misstatements over the years had damaged the government\\'s credibility. Opponents of dredging in Congress pushed for tighter controls and safeguards. The result, in the E.P.A.\\'s final \"record of decision\" issued this year, was a document that mixes equal parts science and sociology. […] \"I guess maybe it\\'s the first time that we can actually say that E.P.A. went in a different direction because of the stance the upper river community has taken,\" said Ms. Pulver, referring to the abandonment of the Saratoga Springs plan. \"That\\'s new.

With the US on terror alert, many assumed the worst after the blast shook nearby homes.  Flames and billowing smoke could be seen from the southern tip of Manhattan.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg was quick to act as 150 firefighters battled the blaze. He called a hastily arranged press conference to allay fears. \"There is absolutely no evidence and no reason to think whatsoever that this is anything other than a very tragic industrial accident,\" Mr Bloomberg said. \"Two people are missing and we fear the worst for them.\" Investigators have yet to determine the cause of the blast, being described by police as a refuelling accident. A barge was loading 15 million litres of unleaded petrol at the Port Mobil fuel storage complex when the cargo ignited, burning for several hours. As well as the workers believed killed, a third with severe burns was rushed to Staten Island University Hospital in a critical but stable condition. Mr Bloomberg said fire marshals were interviewing workers to determine the explosion\\'s cause. Those presumed dead were working on the barge, employees of transportation company Bouchard. Thirty Exxon Mobil staff at work at the time have been accounted for. Some residents who live near the industrial site were evacuated as New York\\'s Department of Environmental Protection set up air monitoring and advised people to stay indoors. Mr Bloomberg was telling New Yorkers once again to \"go about your business\" -- the same plea he was making a week ago when a new terror alert was issued.

Inadequate refining capacity poses a serious threat to security of supply.  It is little wonder that various governments have gone to greats lengths to ensure investment in refineries. The snag, however, is the cost of the exercise, as refineries are not cheap to set up. Several African countries have announced plans to lure investors who will revive their ailing oil-refining sectors. Nigeria is one which has been grappling with problematic oil refineries. [...] The Nigerian government's efforts to give the oil refining sector a new lease on life have included privatising it. However, there has not been a big rush by oil companies or the oil majors - to be specific - to invest in refineries. One of the reasons given for the lack of refinery investment is poor financial return. Strict environmental rules have also been blamed for a lack of investment in the US and Europe. The US - the world's biggest economy - has not built a new refinery since 1976. The move towards cleaner fuels requires owners of existing refineries to modernise and upgrade their assets if they are to remain globally competitive. Energy analyst Cornelis van der Waal of Frost & Sullivan says oil companies with refineries in SA will have to make investments in preparation for the introduction of new fuel emission standards, known as the Euro 4, by 2012. The new standards will require either the construction of new refineries or the upgrading of existing ones. Companies are likely to opt to refurbish existing facilities. [...] In SA, where security of supply is a great concern, the oil industry will be under pressure to upgrade its refineries. The switch to cleaner fuels led to fuel supply disruptions in 2005 as the petroleum industry had to modify its refineries. [...] Recent comments by CHEVRON executive John Watson about the company's intentions for its refineries have fuelled speculation about the fate of the company's refinery at Milnerton in Cape Town.

The firm is one of the major manufacturers for high-voltage, direct- current (HVDC) lines and converter stations. «It's easier to lay a cable underwater, and it's generally better accepted because it's out of sight, out of mind,» he adds, noting that in some cases, an underwater cable is the only option. […] Unlike alternating-current (AC) lines, direct-current lines must have expensive converters at each end to convert the power. However, DC lines can carry electricity an almost infinite distance without losing much, if any, of the current, making them ideal to carry large loads of electricity over long distances. AC lines cannot carry power farther than about 40 miles, says Steve Eckroad, superconductivity program manager at Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, Calif. The Champlain-Hudson would be almost a direct line from new hydroelectric power and other renewable sources in upper Quebec and upstate New York to metropolitan areas. The cable would begin in the Richelieu River in Quebec and then travel south through Lake Champlain and along railroad rights-of-way, avoiding environmentally sensitive areas such as the GENERAL ELECTRIC Co. PCB cleanup site in the upper Hudson River. The cable would enter the Hudson River south of Albany and deliver power to converter stations in Yonkers, N.Y., and Bridgeport, Conn. Jessome says Transmission Developers is still in discussions with HVDC providers and contractors but has completed engineering studies of the route. Installing the cable would require use of a highly specialized boat that can carry about 60 miles of cables. Using global positioning systems and thrusters, the ship is able to lay the cable within 1 meter along the route.

The environmental votes referred to mostly involved shareholder resolutions aimed at forcing companies to adopt Ceres, a set of environmental standards. No proxy votes have resulted in a victory for Ceres, at any company, and the New York City Pension Fund is the only large public pension fund that routinely votes in favor of such social issues.

It found that the company\\'s main effect on global warming came from carbon dioxide emissions by customers who burned its oil. The company had a much smaller effect on global levels of another greenhouse gas, methane, and its effect on nitrogen oxide levels was \"negligible\". Niwa scientists Jim Salinger and Greg Bodeker then put these results into a global climate model and calculated that Exxon Mobil could be blamed for between 3.4 per cent and 3.7 per cent of the 0.6C rise in global temperatures since 1882.

It was an unaccustomed stain on the halo for the firm with the highest brand and repurchase loyalty of any computer manufacturer, a glittering reputation as a design leader, and a fan base as enthusiastic as any rock band\\'s. Greenpeace charged that Apple \"scores badly on almost all criteria\" in a detailed survey of its environmental attitudes and practices, ranging from timetables for phasing out hazardous chemicals to the adoption of the precautionary principle.

When the guide was first published, last September, Apple was ranked 10th; now it is ranked 14th out of 14. In a surprise first place on the list was the Chinese PC maker Lenovo, which displaced Nokia. […] The background to the dispute between Greenpeace and Apple is the growing concern about the phenomenon of e waste - electrical and electronic goods which have come to the end of their lives. The production of all these devices, from computers and printers to CD players and mobile phones, is the fastest-growing sector in the manufacturing industry in the industrialised countries. The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that between 20 and 50 million tons of them are thrown away as obsolete every year - with potentially serious risks to human health and the environment. This is because they are classed as hazardous waste for the toxic chemicals they contain, and so are expensive to recycle properly. Instead, huge amounts are shipped (especially from the US) to China and India, where they are broken up for scrap, often by children, in dumps. Greenpeace is mounting a two-pronged campaign against what it says is an environmental disaster in the making by pressuring the manufacturers both to phase out the toxic chemicals inside the products, and to take responsibility for disposing of the products at the end of their lives by taking them back from customers and recycling them. […] But even more eye-catching is the bottom rating awarded to Apple which, says the group, \"having made no progress since the launch of the Guide in 8 2006, continues to languish in last place\". Greenpeace charges: \"Apple fails to embrace the precautionary principle, withholds its full list of regulated substances, and provides no timelines for eliminating toxic PVC and no commitment to phasing out all uses of brominated flame retardants.

Several appeared yesterday at a news conference in Albany with Walter Hang, the director of an environmental group, Toxics Targeting, that has released a report on PCB contamination in the area. […] In 1999 the agency came back to do a routine check and found that the soil was still contaminated around seven homes, though the source was not clear, Ms. Meicht said. The levels varied from one part per million -- the state\\'s minimum for a cleanup -- to 1,500 parts per million. Anything over 50 parts is classified as toxic waste. Again, the state\\'s contractors dug out all the yards where they found the chemicals and filled them in with clean soil, Ms. Meicht said. Michael Mabb, whose yard next to Mr. Condon\\'s was also dug out, said he thought the excavation stopped only because it was taking too long and was running over the budget. \"It was coming winter and they just wanted to get out of here,\" he said.  Mr. Mabb\\'s wife, Penny, has scars and boils on her arms and legs that are consistent with high-level exposure to PCB\\'s, said David Carpenter, a professor in the School of Public Health at the State University at Albany.

What was little more than a 350-mile-long sewer stretching from the Adirondacks to Manhattan's Battery has been transformed over 30 years into a river pulsing with life. There remains, however, one huge blot on this otherwise happy history -- the polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, that were discharged into the upper Hudson from two General Electric manufacturing plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls and that now lie on the river bottom. The compounds were banned 20 years ago, but enough escaped into the river to pose a potential cancer risk to humans who eat fish caught in the upper Hudson.  Under the Federal Superfund law, G.E. must clean the river of PCB's or find some way to neutralize them. The company has never denied its legal responsibility, but for two decades it has wrestled with state and Federal agencies over scientific questions involving the toxicity of the chemicals and the practical question of how best to purge the river. This struggle has now reached a new and more intense phase with the release last week of a report from the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, which has the authority to tell G.E. what to do. The report makes two key points, neither of them comforting to G.E. […] The E.P.A. regards this theory as improbable. Environmental groups, most vocally Scenic Hudson, see it as another smokescreen for G.E.'s endlessly resourceful environmental team. But wherever the truth lies, it is clear that the Federal Government is conducting a far more careful investigation of a potentially grave environmental problem than it did during the Reagan years.

It also points to \"serious doubts\" over whether companies\\' plans to respond to spills - by capping leaking wells and skimming oil from the sea surface - would work in the rough Atlantic waters off the west coast of Shetland. The report points to the \"limitations\" of the computer modelling used by oil companies to predict the long-term effects of spills at sea. Last month the Guardian obtained documents relating to the oil spill response plan of US firm CHEVRON which in October was given consent to drill off Shetland. It showed its modelling software could not simulate spills lasting more than 14 days without crashing. The Gulf of Mexico spill lasted almost three months.[...] The report also says that EU legislation obliging companies to meet their responsibilities over a spill is vague and inconsistent and \"unlikely to bring to account those responsible for environmental damage caused by an offshore incident such as happened in the Gulf of Mexico\".

But none said they had learned of the plan directly from Mrs. Whitman\\'s office.   Mrs. Whitman\\'s office did not return two calls today seeking confirmation of the plan. She said last week that she would make a decision by the end of this week, and would send it to the Pataki administration for comment. \"It is our understanding that this plan is under serious consideration,\" Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer said. But when asked whom his sources were, he said, \"I will do everything I can not to edify you on that one.\" In December, under President Bill Clinton, the E.P.A. proposed a clean-up plan whose centerpiece would be dredging 2.6 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment from the river at several \"hot spots\" about 40 miles north of here. The cost, estimated at $480 million, would be charged to General Electric, the company whose plants dumped polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB\\'s, a class of cancer-causing chemicals, into the river legally from the 1940\\'s to the 1970\\'s. The plan said to be under consideration by Mrs. Whitman would address only the most contaminated site, a part of the river known as the Thompson Island Pool, near the town of Fort Edward. It would involve removal of about a half-million cubic yards of sediment -- considerably less in some versions of the plan -- and would cost $100 million or less. The results of that dredging would then undergo years of study before a decision was made on whether to proceed with more. G.E. has gone on a multimillion-dollar advertising and public relations campaign against the December E.P.A. plan, asserting that there are better ways to remove the contamination and that dredging would actually worsen matters. A spokesman said today that the company had no idea what Mrs. Whitman would do. […] Two United States representatives from the Hudson Valley, John E. Sweeney and Maurice D. Hinchey, both of whom have met recently on the issue with Mrs. Whitman, said they, too, were in the dark. Mr. Hinchey, a Democrat, supports December\\'s more aggressive plan, while Mr. Sweeney, a Republican whose district includes the most contaminated stretches of the river, has been promoting a narrower dredging plan like the one said to be under consideration.

In 2006, the National Coalition of American Nuns came out against bottled water for the moral reason that life's essential resource should not be privatized. New numbers surfaced: each year the bottles themselves require 17 million barrels of oil to manufacture, and, one expert tells Royte, ''the total energy required for every bottle's production, transport and disposal is equivalent, on average, to filling that bottle a quarter of the way with oil.'' Mayors from San Francisco to New York suddenly became aware of the new symbolism of bottled water as a waste of taxpayer money, a diss of local tap water and a threat to the environment. […]\",\n",

The river bottom will be scoured with clamshell-bucket dredges. Sediment will be dewatered using 12 hydraulic plate-filter presses. Water will be treated to drinking-water standards and returned to the canal. Dried sediment will be sent for disposal at a Texas hazardous-waste landfill. A joint venture of Merco/Obayashi, New Lebanon, N.J., also is mining a tunnel complex 80 ft beneath the river to collect PCBs infiltrating from GE's Hudson Falls site. A 24-ft-dia, 200-ft-deep shaft will lead to two, X-shaped 1,500-ft-long, 10-ft-dia tunnels. A series of wells and horizontal drains will steer the PCBs into the tunnels where it will be pumped to two on-site water treatment plants. […] The project is the result of a contentious battle between GE, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and New York state on how to remediate PCBs, used as insulating fluid in capacitors and now considered a probable carcinogen.

Each year, the farms produce millions of tons of palm oil, which has soared in popularity since the 1970s and is now found in foods like margarine, potato chips and chocolate, as well as in soap, cosmetics and biofuel. Palm produces more oil per hectare than other oil crops, making it a cheaper alternative. […] Last year, the British cosmetics company Lush introduced a soap made from a base free of palm oil. Last month, Cadbury New Zealand bowed to consumer pressure and reversed a decision to replace cocoa butter with palm oil in its chocolates. And the Melbourne Zoo began a campaign to have palm oil clearly labeled on food products to ensure that consumers know what they are buying. The increasingly vocal protests are not what the industry expected five years after it began developing a certification system for producing environmentally sustainable palm oil. In 2004, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil formed, representing palm-oil producers; consumer goods manufacturers including Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and Kellogg; environmental groups like the World Wide Fund for Nature; and social and development organizations.

And although soft drinks are  still No.1, water isn\\'t far behind. […] The \"green\" movement has raised Americans\\'  consciousness about carbon footprints and recycling. Water has become another green concern. Natural supplies of clean, fresh water  could dry up if we don\\'t start paying attention to where water comes from, what we do to it and why we drink it.[…] In Bottlemania, she explores how water is accessed, packaged and sold; compares tap water with bottled water; and muses on the commodification of a natural resource. She raises questions about bottled water\\'s surging sales and its impact on society and the environment -- and explains what she\\'s learned in a straightforward, conversational voice that makes even the densest statistics and scientific explanations accessible (well, almost). Royte traveled to Fryeburg, Maine. An aquifer there is a source for Nestle-owned Poland Spring, which built a bottling plant in nearby Hollis. Fryeburg residents are at odds about whether they should welcome or shun the corporate interloper. Royte writes about Coca-Cola (Dasani) and PEPSICO (Aquafina).

Environmentalists said the lukewarm response from the public might be related to the technical nature of the Environmental Impact Assessment reports, which total 3,000 pages. Ng Cho-nam, president of the Conservancy Association, criticised the Government for not taking the initiative to seek public opinion on large-scale strategic development.  Mr Ng, who is an associate professor of environmental management at Hong Kong University, said the public were not interested in studying the two assessments as they could not see the direct impact the projects would have on them. Among the 31 other environmental impact reports released for public consultation in the past, 19 received no response.  The remaining 12 received between one and 11 submissions. An Environmental Protection Department spokesman said the public consultation aimed to ensure transparency of the assessment process and they would study every comment in detail. The seven Disney-related submissions raised many questions over the findings of the reports, which concluded that the Disneyland theme park, due to open in 2005, should be able to comply with environmental laws. One submission was from the group, Hong Kong Dolphinwatch, which criticised the findings that there would be a limited impact on dolphins as \"misleading and inaccurate\". Another submission from a lecturer from the General Education Centre of the Polytechnic University, Dr John Babson, urged the Director of Environmental Protection not to issue environmental permits to the Disneyland project without a full assessment of the ecological and cultural heritage of Penny\\'s Bay.

Anyone who has patented a green process or product can contribute it to the commons. There, the patent is made available for anyone to use, for free. IBM contributed a patent for a green cleaning process used in electronics manufacturing and one for environmentally friendly packaging materials.

[…] The researchers, a team of 18 scientists from an array of academic, federal, and private research centers, said many options should be explored because some were bound to fail and success, somewhere, was essential.[…] As they now exist, most energy technologies, the scientists said, \"have severe deficiencies.\" Solar panels, new nuclear power options, windmills, filters for fossil fuel emissions and other options are either inadequate or require vastly more research and development than is currently planned in the United States or elsewhere, they said. The assessment contrasts with an analysis of climate-friendly energy options made last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of experts that works under United Nations auspices. That analysis concluded that existing technologies, diligently applied, would solve much of the problem. One author of the new analysis, Dr. Haroon S.

              " '[…] WHEN John Styth Pemberton, an Atlanta, Georgia, pharmacist, invented Coca-Cola in 1886, it was a fountain soda sold at the counter. Soon, along with countless other brands, the product was sold in bottles. It then became a two-tiered business: Brand owners distributed their heavily marked-up, proprietary flavoured syrups across the United States; smaller independent bottlers blended the syrups with sweetener and carbonated water and trucked the pop to local stores. The bottling business was high-volume, low-margin. To keep their material costs down, bottlers used refillable glass bottles and charged small deposits on them to make sure they were returned. That changed in the 1970s and \\'80s when the soft-drink industry shifted to steel cans and throwaway plastic bottles. These were convenient for consumers but, more importantly, they allowed soft-drink giants such as Coke and Pepsi to vastly increase their market share. Not having to rely on local bottling plants meant they could flood whole regions of North America with their products though massive one-way warehouse distribution systems. Their increased market clout -- made possible by the new packaging and economies of scale -- allowed them to push competing mom-and-pop local brands out of the market. Today, there are hundreds of soft drinks, iced teas, fizzy juices and isotonic sports drinks, but most are owned by a handful of huge companies. Bottle deposits went the way of the dinosaur. The companies got into trouble when the convenient throwaways became litter at the same time that the modern environmental movement started. Soon, states and provinces introduced \"bottle bill\" legislation to force deposits on soft drink containers. The common \"return for deposit where applicable\" stamp was born. Today, 11 American states and every Canadian province and territory except Ontario and Manitoba require deposits on pop containers. Activists love them because they divert very high volumes of containers from landfill to recycling (often more than 90 per cent). The bottle goes back to the store, and the store sends it for recycling. But soft-drink companies and retailers hate deposit-return schemes since these complicate their otherwise efficient one-way distribution systems. […] Faced with the threat of deposits and an increasingly environmentally sensitive public, the soft-drink industry, its packaging suppliers and the grocers got together and devised a solution. They renamed their throwaway containers \"recyclable\" and formed associations to fund municipal curbside recycling programs. Activists had promoted residential recycling for years, but programs usually failed due to lack of markets for the scrap material. The pop companies had an ingenious idea: They agreed to switch from steel to aluminum cans so that revenue from this high-value metal would offset losses from the other junk. The so-called \"basket of goods\" approach was born in which the declining value of some recycled commodities is balanced out by the rising value of others.[…] So what\\'s the problem? Activist groups such as John Jackson\\'s Citizen\\'s Action Committee on Waste and Gordon Perks\\' Toronto Environmental Alliance argue that the rate that garbage is recycled has stalled at less than 50 per cent, even in the best-run curbside programs.

In a column this week in The Guardian, Mr. Monbiot laments the failure of green activists to reach beyond a \"set of deep beliefs ... that in some cases remain unexamined.\" Mostly, he said, the battle over energy supplies and carbon emissions has plunged the environmental movement into choosing objectives that \"are at odds\" with one another.  Green predictions of collapse have not materialized as the global carbon-based economic expansion continues. \"The problem we face,\" he said, \"is not that we have too little fossil fuel, but too much.\" As conventional oil declines, economies will switch to tar sands, shale gas and coal.

The pools, which sit on the top level of the reactor buildings and keep spent fuel submerged in water, had lost their cooling systems, and plant operators have been unable to take emergency steps because of the multiplying crises. By late Tuesday, the water meant to cool spent fuel rods in the No. 4 reactor was boiling, Japan's nuclear watchdog said. If the water evaporates and the rods run dry, they could overheat and catch fire, potentially spreading radioactive materials in dangerous clouds.  Shigekatsu Oomukai, a spokesperson for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, said the substantial capacity of the pool meant that the water in it was unlikely to evaporate soon. But he said workers were having difficulty reaching the pool to cool it. Temperatures appeared to be rising in the spent fuel pools at two other reactors at the plant, No. 5 and No. 6, said Yukio Edano, the chief cabinet secretary. Meanwhile, workers continued to pump seawater into the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors, where cooling systems remained unusable. The pools are a concern at the stricken reactors because at least two of the three have lost their roofs in explosions, exposing the spent fuel pools to the atmosphere. By contrast, reactors have strong containment vessels that stand a better chance of bottling up radiation from a meltdown of the fuel in the reactor core. Nuclear experts said that if spent fuel rods in such a pool were to catch fire, the high heat would loft the radiation in clouds that would spread the radioactivity.

The environmental group wants a moratorium on all new deepwater licences.

The US oil giant has also admitted in its official documents that oil from a spill near the Shetland Islands could theoretically reach Greenland and the Norfolk coast line.

The announcement comes as CHEVRON awaits the outcome of its appeal against the 6 decision by the Environmental Protection Authority to reject plans to build the Gorgon liquefied natural gas plant on Barrow Island because of the potential risk to the island\\'s flora and fauna. CHEVRON\\'s appeal against the EPA ruling is now being considered by appeals convener Garry Middle, who will report to State Environment Minister Mark McGowan later this year. Unlike the EPA, the Minister will also consider the social and economic implications of blocking the Gorgon project, and is widely expected to approve the venture subject to strict conditions. CHEVRON and partners Shell and ExxonMobil hope to be able to approve the Gorgon project early next year in a bid to start production in 2011-12. The timing of CHEVRON\\'s announcement echoes that of Shell\\'s decision in 2000 to make Perth one of three \"global centres of excellence\" for its worldwide exploration and production activities at the height of its failed bid for Woodside Petroleum.

              " \"With the Japanese authorities working to avert a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and one other Japanese plant showing problems, the safety of America's nuclear plants -- and the wisdom of any expansion -- is beginning to come under a new round of scrutiny. Although exactly what happened at Japan's nuclear power plants is still being sorted out, most of the nuclear plants in the United States share some or all of the risk factors that played a role at Fukushima Daiichi: locations on tsunami-prone coastlines or near earthquake faults, aging plants and backup electrical systems that rely on diesel generators and batteries that could fail in extreme circumstances. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and the director of the Nuclear Safety Project of the Union of Concerned Scientists, suggested Sunday that while emergency preparedness and safety redundancies were built into the DNA of every nuclear plant in the United States, the string of events that damaged the Fukushima plant was beyond the sort of situations imagined by nuclear regulators and plant designers. ''The real situation they found themselves in is not really planned for,'' Mr. Lochbaum said. ''Those plants are designed to be highly resistant to damage by earthquakes, and as immune as possible to tsunami. The problem was the one-two punch. We design against these sorts of things in isolation, and the combination is a little beyond what they would have anticipated.'' On Sunday, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent a letter to President Obama calling for a moratorium on new nuclear plants until more coherent federal procedures for nuclear emergencies were ironed out. ''In stark contrast to the scenarios contemplated for oil spills and hurricanes, there is no specificity for emergency coordination and command in place for a response to a nuclear disaster,'' Mr. Markey said in a statement. Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of the nation's electricity, and there are 104 reactors licensed to operate in 31 states, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A majority are so-called pressurized water reactors, different from the GENERAL ELECTRIC boiling water reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.

              " \"ABSTRACT The emergency flooding of two stricken reactors with seawater and the resulting steam releases are a desperate step intended to avoid a full meltdown of the nuclear cores in two reactors.  FULL TEXT As the scale of Japan's nuclear crisis begins to come to light, experts in Japan and the United States say the country is now facing a cascade of accumulating problems that suggest that radioactive releases of steam from the crippled plants could go on for weeks or even months. The emergency flooding of two stricken reactors with seawater and the resulting steam releases are a desperate step intended to avoid a much bigger problem: a full meltdown of the nuclear cores in two reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. On Monday, an explosion blew the roof off the second reactor, not damaging the core, officials said, but presumably leaking more radiation. So far, Japanese officials have said the melting of the nuclear cores in the two plants is assumed to be ''partial,'' and the amount of radioactivity measured outside the plants, though twice the level Japan considers safe, has been relatively modest.  But Pentagon officials reported Sunday that helicopters flying 100 kilometers, or 60 miles, from the plant picked up small amounts of radioactive particulates - still being analyzed, but presumed to include cesium 137 and iodine 121 - suggesting widening environmental contamination. In a country where memories of a nuclear horror of a different sort in the last days of World War II weigh heavily on the national psyche and national politics, the impact of continued venting of long-lasting radioactivity from the plants is hard to overstate. Japanese reactor operators now have little choice but to periodically release radioactive steam as part of an emergency cooling process for the fuel of the stricken reactors that may continue for a year or more even after fission has stopped. The plant's operator must constantly try to flood the reactors with seawater, then release the resulting radioactive steam into the atmosphere, several experts familiar with the design of the Daiichi facility said. That suggests that the tens of thousands of people who have been evacuated may not be able to return to their homes for a considerable period, and that shifts in the wind could blow radioactive materials toward Japanese cities rather than out to sea. […] Another potential concern is that some Japanese reactors (as well as some in France and Germany) run on a mixed fuel known as mox, or mixed oxide, that includes reclaimed plutonium. It is not clear whether the stricken reactors are among those, but if they are, the steam they release could be more toxic. Christopher D. Wilson, a reactor operator and later a manager at Exelon's Oyster Creek plant, near Toms River, New Jersey, said, ''normally you would just re-establish electricity supply, from the on-site diesel generator or a portable one.'' Portable generators have been brought into Fukushima, he said. Fukushima was designed by GENERAL ELECTRIC, as Oyster Creek was around the same time, and the two plants are similar. The problem, he said, was that the hookup is done through electric switching equipment that is in a basement room flooded by the tsunami, he said.

[…] More than 20 major companies are involved in the pipeline, but the PNG Gas Project, a partnership of CHEVRON Niugini, Merlin Petroleum, Oil Search, Orogen Minerals and Petroleum Resources, is charged with the extraction, transportation and marketing of the gas. Project director Dr John Powell says projects now not even envisaged will emerge once the gas begins to flow. […] One of the project\\'s greatest boasts is an environmental one. By using \"greenhouse friendly\" natural gas to fuel power stations, rather than other fossil fuels, more than 88 million tonnes of CO2 emissions can be prevented from entering the atmosphere. Queensland is expected to boost the proportion of energy derived from natural gas from the present 6 per cent to near the 44 per cent Western Australia achieved after North West Shelf gas came on stream.

              " \"Twenty-five years after the federal government declared a long stretch of the Hudson River to be a contaminated Superfund site, the cleanup of its chief remaining source of pollution began here Friday with a single scoop of mud extracted by a computer-guided dredge. Twelve dredges are to work round the clock, six days a week, into October, removing sediment laced with the chemicals known as PCBs. Mile-long freight trains running every several days will carry the dried mud to a hazardous-waste landfill in Texas. An estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, flowed into the upper Hudson from two GENERAL ELECTRIC  factories for three decades before they were banned, in 1977, as a health threat to people and wildlife. In high doses, they have been shown to cause cancer in animals and are listed by federal agencies as a probable human carcinogen. ''Today, the healing of the Hudson begins,'' George Pavlou, the Environmental Protection Agency's acting regional administrator, said under bright skies in a riverbank ceremony here as federal, state and local officials, G.E. representatives and environmental campaigners looked on. […] He said G.E. had acted in good faith for many years and that in 2002, its chairman, Jeffrey R. Immelt, made a public pledge to cooperate and implement the dredging plan, drafted and approved by the E.P.A. Three related accords have since been signed, he said, and the company has met every commitment so far. In organizing the ceremony near the first dredging spot, the agency cast the moment as a milestone in the history of the river and of environmental governance in the United States. Yet environmental officials and groups that spent years fighting GENERAL ELECTRIC 's efforts to challenge the need to remove the mud were more critical. Edward O. Sullivan, who from 1987 to 1995 wrestled with GENERAL ELECTRIC  lawyers and scientists as New York State's deputy commissioner of environmental conservation and ran the state's hazardous-waste cleanup program, said that by pursuing the court challenge to the Superfund law and reserving the right to reject the second phase of the cleanup, GENERAL ELECTRIC  had constructed two potential ''escape hatches.''

              " 'Something strange is happening to fish in north Florida\\'s Fenholloway River:  Some of the females are developing male sex organs. Researchers at the University of West Florida and the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency think pollution from an upstream wood pulp mill is the  culprit. They say that the phenomenon, which has shown up in three fish  species so far, could contaminate the food chain, spreading to other aquatic  species and even affecting people who eat the fish.[…] Consumer products giant PROCTER & GAMBLE built the mill in 1952, putting  Perry on the map. Four years ago, PROCTER & GAMBLE sold the mill to Buckeye Cellulose, which  is run by former PROCTER & GAMBLE executives. The company still is the Perry  mill\\'s biggest customer for pulp, which is used in such products as disposable  diapers, rayon fabric, coffee filters, automobile tires, sausage casings and  pharmaceuticals. Buckeye Cellulose, which owns several other mills, saw its net earnings  double in the 1996 fiscal year. Today, even Buckeye officials agree with environmentalists that building  the mill on the Fenholloway was a mistake, because the river is too small to  handle the plant\\'s waste. The mill chews up pine trees 24 hours a day, discharging 50-million gallons  of effluent into the river. Plant officials say that kind of volume would have less impact on the  environment if it could be diluted. But some critics call the pipeline project  a \\'40s solution to a \\'90s pollution problem. Their favorite slogan is  \"dilution is not the solution to pollution.\"[…] The pollution isn\\'t just being pumped away, he said, it also is being  reduced. Improvements at the mill will reduce chlorine use by half, reducing  the chance that harmful dioxin compounds will be released. The company has  been working to reduce dioxin for several years. In 1990, state officials  banned fishing in the river because of dioxin contamination. Today, Buckeye  has no detectable dioxin discharge, Simmons said. The fishing ban, however,  still is in effect.[…] For years, private drinking water wells in Perry have produced water that  is brown and smelly. PROCTER & GAMBLE often drilled new wells and handed out  free bottled water. Several years ago, more than 100 residents with bad water filed a federal  class-action suit against the company, but it was dismissed because the  homeowners could not prove enough financial damage. Buckeye and Florida  taxpayers paid to connect affected homeowners to city water. Despite years of testing, the state has never conclusively tied the well  pollution to the paper mill, mostly because the chemicals at issue are so  complex. There are chemicals in the waste and in the wells the state can\\'t  identify. […] When Cummings went to get her free bottled water from PROCTER & GAMBLE  several years ago, she brought along a crew from television\\'s 60 Minutes.  She  carried a tank of contaminated fish to Washington in the back of a pickup  truck and presented them to Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Carol  Browner. She went to Cincinnati, to the home of PROCTER & GAMBLE\\'s president,  and knocked on his door. When his wife answered, Cummings stood there with a  jug of contaminated water. \"Ma\\'am,\" she said, in a deep Panhandle drawl. \"Your husband is polluting  our water something awful.\"[…]',\n",

But an application to tap into a second source of water from the famous springs on the Herefordshire-Worcestershire border has left conservation groups furious.

Portland GENERAL ELECTRIC's (PGE) longest-running generation facility, one of the three oldest hydroelectric plants in the US, is headed for another 30 years of operation. On 2 February 2004, Portland, Oregon-based PGE submitted an agreement to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), that will be a key step in renewing its license for the 16MW T.W. Sullivan plant. Under the agreement, signed by a variety of governmental, environmental and tribal organisations, the Willamette Falls power house will operate with enhanced production capacity and environmental protections. It provides for several improvements to assist the downstream passage of juvenile fish. In addition, PGE will assume maintenance and any necessary improvements to the facility's fish ladder to help adult salmon and steelhead move upstream. Improvements to the downstream facilities include moving fish through a tunnel currently used to take water around the plant. A gated opening, or 'flow structure' will also be created at the top of the falls to better direct fish downstream. The goal is to achieve a safe passage rate of 98% or better. […] History In 1883, the dam at Willamette Falls was constructed to exploit the hydro power potential of the site. The 899.2m-long dam uses the hydraulic head of the falls, a natural horseshoe-shaped cascade approximately 12.2m in height. The dam runs along the top of the falls between two power houses, varying in height from 1.8-6.1m. The dam maintains a consistent water level (but does not provide water storage) to which the hydroelectric projects, several mills and the US Army Corps of Engineers navigation locks are built.

One landmark study, done in 2004 by Australian researchers led by William von Hippel, involved 256 Chinese men, aged 50 to 76 years.

And, while they acknowledge it is hard to get data on the trade of contraband animal parts, they found the price of the male genitalia of Canadian seals remained low in 2001 and 2002, despite improved markets for pelts and oil from these animals. They conclude that \"this depressed trade in seal penises, in combination with our survey of traditional Chinese medicine consumers, indicates that Viagra [which was introduced in 1998] and other new erectile dysfunction drugs may be having a conservation benefit, at least with regard to certain animal species.\" Critics, including Craig Hoover of the World Wildlife Fund, have challenged von Hippel\\'s interpretation of the data, noting other factors -- such as ice conditions and the ending of Canadian government subsidies on seal meat -- may have affected the seal harvest, which is primarily about pelts and not penises anyway.

And yes, we\\'ve tried the pretend over-the-counter \"dry-cleaning\" kits and, well, now we\\'re back at the cleaners.  The problem is perchlorethylene, a chemical that has been used in dry cleaning since the 1930s, and is considered a toxic carcinogen that can harm people, water supplies and the atmosphere. Recent studies have drawn awareness to the effects of PERC-laden clothes in the car (even of its seeping into groceries, yuck) and the home. It seems to have no redeeming qualities, in fact.  \"Almost everyone uses dry cleaners, but not everyone knows what it is,\" says Tim Yoo of Toronto\\'s Eco Cleaners, who recently turned to a new technology because of concern about the effects of PERC on consumers and dry-cleaning workers.  GreenEarth Cleaning, formed in a 1999 partnership between PROCTOR & GAMBLE and General Electric, uses a silicone-based solvent they describe as \"liquid sand.\" Tiny droplets of the solvent seep into the clothes and attach themselves to dirt and oil, which they take with them when they\\'re extracted.  The company says it\\'s non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-allergenic and completely biodegradable. Prices so far aren\\'t that far out of whack from what many spend at ordinary cleaners: At Eco Cleaners, a two-piece suit is $17.75, a blouse is $6.85.  Tim Maxwell, the Toronto-based president of GreenEarth, which is headquartered in Kansas, says the company has sold 11 machines across Canada and 1,000 machines worldwide. It\\'s a drop in the bucket: In North America alone, there are 35,000 dry-cleaning machines.

One of the main items to be discussed at the Rio+20 summit is the status of carbon emissions mitigation, particularly CO2. While initiatives have targeted CO2 emissions with some success, much remains to be done, and countries must now look at other forms of carbon emissions to break the deadlock. One of those emissions is black carbon, commonly known as soot - a recognized public health hazard and contributor to global warming. Fortunately, reducing black carbon is much easier than reducing other kinds of emissions like CO2. And a market-based international system incentivizing reduction of carbon emissions is already in place.[…] The concept of carbon trading emerged from the Kyoto Protocol as a way for countries to trade their greenhouse gas emission rights. With a set number of emission rights, a country that had a hard time reducing its emissions could essentially pay another country to reduce its emissions by the appropriate amount. The argument was that it would be cheaper for a less developed country to reduce emissions than it would be for a developed country, but the goal of emission reduction would still be achieved. […] So a company like General Motors or IBM, seeking to reduce its carbon footprint, might end up buying emission credits in a carbon market, thus monetizing the efforts of some social entrepreneurs who risk their capital in financing carbon reduction projects. If a black carbon reduction project cost the social entrepreneur $10 per carbon ton to pay for engine improvements, he can hope corporate buyers will pay $11 per ton in the carbon markets to allow him to make a $1 profit per ton of carbon that his project was able to reduce.[…]',\n",

In fact, the environmental benefits of IGCC are not as clear as they would appear to be at first. Generally speaking, IGCC technology reduces nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions and uses significantly less water than a PC plant. […] In addition, the cost premium of IGCC compared with a pulverized coal plant works against IGCC\\'s environmental advantages.

The plan is still very much in its infancy and the federal Government has made no commitment to funding the project. Santos hopes to have a demonstration plant running by 2010 and to prove the concept is viable by ''sequestering'' or burying one million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the equivalent of taking 250,000 cars off the road.

Water scarcity has been on scientists\\' minds and humanitarian organisations\\' agendas for some time, but it seems that despite some daunting figures, the alarm bells are just not loud enough. According to data collected by CITIGROUP, precipitation patterns are changing locations and are becoming heavier, briefer and less frequent. Australia\\'s rainfall trend is switching from west to east. Drought is increasing as precipitation over land has marginally decreased while evaporation has increased. Pollution is rising. Water in most of China\\'s five major rivers is unsafe for direct human contact and nearly two thirds of China\\'s large cities are facing serious wastewater pollution. Snow cover is decreasing and from the South American Andes to the Asian Indus River basin, the area covered by glaciers is shrinking. [...] \"You can\\'t pipe water across Australia, water is heavy and relatively low cost, so transportation costs are too expensive,\" says Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth Management, \"while you pipe oil across Alaska.\" [...]',\n",
              " 'CARBON emissions will continue to rise over the next 20 years, with measures to reduce climate change outstripped by increased energy demand from emerging economies, according to analysis by BP. [...] It expects non-fossil fuels, such as nuclear, hydro-electricity and renewable sources to make up 18 per cent of energy growth in the next 20 years, but predicts fossil fuels will still make up 64 per cent of the global increase. [...] ExxonMobil is due to release its long-term energy outlook in the coming weeks, and is expected to paint a similarly gloomy picture about cutting global emissions.',\n",
