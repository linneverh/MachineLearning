    "The goal of this walkthrough is to provide you with insights on exploratory data analysis throughout the use of a fun and interactive technique known as web scraping. During this laboratory, you will be provided with a broad overview of this technique as well as the major tools used in the process. You will also understand how data analysis can be conducted on real-time web data and hopefully see how this combination can be further applied to any other context. \n",

In our example, web scraping is used as a fun way to extract data that we will analyze afterwards. In most cases, this technique comes hand in hand with data cleaning and data analysis.

Around 820 CE, he worked at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, the contemporary capital city of the Abbasid Caliphate.\n",

One of his achievements in algebra was his demonstration of how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square, for which he provided geometric justifications.[8]: 14  Because al-Khwarizmi was the first person to treat algebra as an independent discipline and introduced the methods of \"reduction\" and \"balancing\" (the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation),[9] he has been described as the father[10][11][12] or founder[13][14] of algebra. The English term algebra comes from the short-hand title of his aforementioned treatise (الجبر Al-Jabr,  transl. \"completion\" or \"rejoining\").[15] His name gave rise to the English terms algorism and algorithm; the Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese terms algoritmo; and the Spanish term guarismo[16] and Portuguese term algarismo, both meaning 'digit'.[17]\n",
